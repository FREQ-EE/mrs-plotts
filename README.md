# Mrs. Plotts: Your Personal Data Cleaning Assistant!

### *"Tidying up data is a bit like keeping the castle in order: a task best done with a gentle hand and a keen eye!"*

---
## Overview

Welcome! My name is Mrs. Plotts, and just like I used to keep Beast's castle in order, I’m here to help you tidy up your messy data. Whether it’s renaming columns, handling duplicates, or filling in missing values, I’ll guide you through it all with a warm cup of tea and a reassuring word.

Of course, I recommend reviewing everything before finalising, just to ensure everything's neat as a teapot. And, as I always say, backups are a must! You wouldn't want to lose anything important—like when I nearly lost Chip in the washing, would you?

### What I Can Do for You:
- **Load your data** from a CSV file
- **Give an overview** of the data’s shape, types, and missing values
- **Rename columns**
- **Identify and handle duplicates** (because two of the same is a bit redundant, isn’t it?)
- **Help with data types**, offering conversions to common types like integers, floats, and dates
- **Handle categorical data**, allowing you to rename or inspect categories
- **Handle missing data** by dropping rows, imputing values, or even interpolating the gaps

All that while making sure your data is neat, tidy, and ready for analysis!


## How to Employ Me (Setup Instructions):
Before we get started, you’ll need to set a few things in order, much like straightening out a dusty library shelf. Here’s how:

1. **Install the required packages**:  
   Run the following command to make sure all the necessary libraries are in place:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:   
   Once you’ve installed the required packages, simply run the Python script:
   ```
   python mrs_plotts.py
   ```
   And I’ll be ready to help you tidy up that data, much like how I always kept the castle sparkling!

## Required:
1. **CSV File**: You’ll need to provide the full path to your CSV file, dear. If you’re unsure where it is, just give it a good look through your directories.
2. **Decision-Making**: Throughout the process, I’ll ask you a few questions about how you'd like to proceed. Don't worry—I'll guide you every step of the way.

Follow my prompts to provide your CSV file path, and then watch as I tidy things up for you! I’ll show you what needs fixing and ask for your input.

## A Few Extra Bits of Wisdom:
- Backups: Always make a backup of your original data before we get started. I’ve gone ahead and made a copy of the file for you, but it's always good to keep another!
- Review: As much as I try to handle everything perfectly, I encourage you to review the cleaned data before saving it, just like how I always check on Chip before bedtime.
## Feedback and Improvements:
Now, I may be experienced in keeping things in order, but there's always room to learn! If you’d like to see any improvements or suggest any changes, feel free to send feedback my way. After all, I’m here to help, and the more feedback I get, the better I can serve.
## In My Spare Time:
When I’m not busy helping you clean your data, you’ll find me in the castle kitchen, baking bread or having a chat with Lumière. I may even hum a little tune, but don’t mind me, dear—old habits die hard!

*Thank you for considering Mrs. Plotts. I promise to help you keep your data as polished and proper as a freshly set tea table!*
